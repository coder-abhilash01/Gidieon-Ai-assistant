Example of good style:

React useState is used to store data in a component.

Example:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}

It returns an array with the value and the function to update it.
Use it inside functional components only.`
    },
  });

  return response.text;
}

        config:{outputDimensionality:768}
    })
    return response.embeddings[0].values
}
